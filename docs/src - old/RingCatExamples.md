# Tambara Yamagami Fusion Categories

For a detailed intrutuction to Tambara-Yamagami categories we refer to [TY](https://doi.org/10.1006/jabr.1998.7558).

Let ``A`` be a finite abelian group with ``n`` elements. The Tambara-Yamagami fusion category ``TY_A`` has ``n+1`` simple objects of which ``n`` are invertible. We denote the simple objects by ``a_1,...,a_n\in A`` and ``m``. The monoidal product is given by ``a_i \otimes a_j = a_i\cdot a_j``, ``a_i \otimes m = m \otimes a_i = m`` and ``m \otimes m = a_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus a_n``.

# The Motivation 

This package began its journey asking the question "Can we play around 
with explicit categorical entities in the computer?".

By nature categorical operations and constructions are very generic and 
can be applied as long as the objects (or morphisms) are fitting. 
TensorCategories.jl provides an interface for categories with additional 
structure, precisely additive, linear, abelian, monoidal, tensor and 
fusion categories.

# Interface for Abelian Categories

Abelian categories are all over the place and very important.
Thus we provide an Interface for (pre)additive and abelian categories. First recall the definitions:

A __preadditive category__ is a category $\mathcal C$ such that all Hom-spaces are abelian groups and composition is bilinear. As a consequence all finite products are biproducts, also called direct sums. 

Then $\mathcal C$ is called __additive__ if it is preadditive and all finite products exist.

    "# Fusion Categories in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorCategories.jl aims to provide a framework for explicit computations with tensor categories. I.e. we work with constructive models of tensor categories or also finitary categories. Most categories are modelled by providing objects and morphisms in any pleasant form. Most of the time this means morphisms are in some way given by matrices or families of matrices. \n",

    "## Graded Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A great starting example is the category of $G$-graded vector spaces $\\mathrm{Vec}_G$. The category is modelled by objects given as tuples $V = (g_1,...,g_n)$ where the $g_i \\in G$ are the gradings of the basis vectors. Therefore morphisms are encoded as matrices that obey the grading gifting us composition as matrix multiplication."

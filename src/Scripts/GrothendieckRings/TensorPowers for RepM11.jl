    The category Rep(M‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ) over ùîΩ‚ÇÇ has four simple objects 
    of dimension 1,10,32 and 44. We consider the tensor
    power category of the 10-dimensional representation.
    It has seven indecomposable objects which we call
    a,b,c,d,e,f and g, a being the unit and b the
    generator. The computation is very expensive, thus 
    here a quick construction. 

    The minimal polynomials are 

        b‚Åµ - 12b‚Å¥ + 19b¬≥ + 12b¬≤ - 20b
        c‚Åµ - 94c‚Å¥ - 116c¬≥ + 1560c¬≤ - 1920c
